You left off trying to initialize a project for the site.

Testing

You got bad news about grandma while doing it.

- You started a backend
    created an env
    made its own folder
    didnt finish populating the env with the right packages
    you did install flask cors
    you made a requirements page
    You structured your folder so that it is heroku friendly when needed...
    It will be the contents of build (manaully made) that get pushed.  Heroku asks for env, files etc...

- You need to run the backend flask app you created and test it using a test client pytest.
- After that you can push the backend to heroku for a build.  Once thats done you'll be able to push the front end.  
- But before doing that you need to create the front end and run a basic test connection.

dont forget to link the two. 5

- started a front end folder
     you did nothing but make a folder.
